## About
This project contains a "src workthrough" for the SDET (Selenium + Java) course about building a selenium based test framework in the "more or less" true OOP style:) 

This project should be also a good guide for all who wants to start committing to [Selenide](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide) project.

## Notes
Src files have not being fully published yet. TBD.
