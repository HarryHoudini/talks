## About
This project is a result of building automation from scratch for [Grible](grible.org) in the "more or less" true OOP style:) 

Grible is rather useless web app, but with pretty complicated UI (many complex elements/blocks repeated through different pages, excel-style talbes, etc.), implemented under the hood in rather ugly way. This makes it very good example in context of automation;)

"The true OOP" style means that test model (pages, complex blocks of elements) are implemented using "more or less" OOP approach, where every "block of html elements" that reflect some real "entity on UI" is represented in the code as an object (aka widget or ElementObject). 

This approach is the most powerful in languages like Java (since it does not support other paradigms, like Functional Programming in a good enough way). And though this power is actually not needed on the majority of projects:) - there may be good reasons to use it:

- if you or your Lead are "fa-OOP-natics" :)
- if you want to impress your management with "state of the art OOP like automation"
- if for some reason you have to use OOP on your project
  - you have very very complicated UI and ugly inside, e.g. given block of elements that looks similar but have different implementation on different pages, - you have to implement some bulk operations on them (you need OOP Abstraction and Polymorphism here)
  - you have to use two browsers in one test
    - e.g. if you are testing social network you may want to open two browsers with different users logged in, and implement some scenario including steps from different users.
- if you want to involve "newcomers with lack of development experience" into writing tests
  - but keeping them out of the "test framework boat"
    - implementation of test model is much more complicated with OOP approach than Procedural/Modular approach. But in usage this "OOP" Test Model is more handy and easy. Actually this project should show this (look for test scenario code below)
  - if you want newcomers to commit to test framework implementation, i.e. write PageObjects - then you may want to consider Procedural/Modular approach (see [diaspora tests](https://github.com/juliaviluhina/diasporatests) for example)

## Notes on sources  

Feel free to surf the sources of this project to get familiar with the implementation. There you will find comments of this style:

```java
        storage.column(0).setName("user");
        storage.addColumnAfter(0, "password");

        /* + more "obvious" and friendly for "newcomer"
         * - needs additional DataStorages#table method in context of implementation
         *   - and then also additional TestTable#table method
         *     with the same "kind of" duplicated implementation

         * ~
        Table table = new Table();

        table.column(0).setName("user");
        table.addColumnAfter(0, "password");
         * + KISS
         * + table as widget can be reused on other relevant pages
         * - "newcomer" need to learn more "widgets" to start using such approach
         */
```

The meaning is the following:

- comments block starts with information about preceding code
  - `+` indicates the strong point about it (pros)
  - `-` indicates the weak point about it (cons)
  - `*` may indicate "just some details"

- then follows the "alternative code" with one of the following preceding marks:
  - `>` means that "alternative code" is weaker than original
  - `>=` means that "alternative coe" is almost the same but a bit weaker than original
  - `~` means that "alternative code" is "more or less" the same, and it's more a "choice of taste"... but for somebody it may be "weaker" :)
  
- then follows the information (pros and cons) about alternative code

## The actual scenario implemented:

```java
    @Test
    public void createsTestTableBasedOnDataStorageForNewProduct() {
        GIVEN("At Home page");
        Home home = new Home();
        home.open();

        THEN("edit current column name and add one more column");

        EXPECT("Test table with one column 'editme' and one empty row");
        Table table =
                testTables.table();  // or: dataStorages.storage();

        storage.shouldHaveColumnHeaders("editme");
        storage.shouldHaveRows(
                asList("")
        );

        THEN("Configure first column to be connected to data storage prepared above");

        ContextMenu menu;

        menu = table.column(0).menu();
        menu.open();

        refresh();

        table.shouldHaveRows(
                asList("1", "true"),
                asList("2", "false")
        );
    }
```

It's very long, which may not be very good, but actually it reflects the main business flow of the grible. It's pretty good to have at least 1 (and most probably not more) such long End to End scenario implemented for "covering integration aspects of testing". Though it may be also a good idea to break this long scenario into two or three separate ones, but better to take such decision on real project taking into account it specifics.

The Allure Report for this scenario will look like this:
